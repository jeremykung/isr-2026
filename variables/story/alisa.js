console.log("Once upon a merry timeth, at which the swines did not flyeth, lived a jolly fellow called " + mainCharacter + ". Larry wast a " + "simple lad, but, unf'rtunately, life hadst not been kind to him, for he wast born into a base'r-class family, on 'them streets'." + "But the Gods hast und'restimat'd Larry, for that giggly gent posses'd incredible power of resilience. For at the very tend'r age of " + age + "Larry hast accomplish'd what nay man alive couldst doth: he acquired a pristine postion as a " + job1 + " AND a truly respectable, " + "professional profession of " + job2 + ". Alas, for Larry is a jolly gentle gent, he wouldst nev'r brag of his success." + "And so our dear " + mainCharacter + " wouldst wend on to liveth his humble life, if only that he would not be in this story..." + "For, one thing to establisheth, is yond our Larry is a rather naive wee lad. And the one witty individual to exploit his weakness wast " + friend + ", a dear friend of Larry's. Larry and Jimmy were two formidable dram bairns, a 'power duo' if one may. Their friendship rivalled the strongest" + " of earthquakes and the most pow'rful of tidal waves, for their the sheer broth'rhood couldst teareth apart the earth. The two lads were joined " + "like brothers, heart to heart, no matter what life hadst thrown upon them; Jimmy aid'd Larry with his businessman powers, lending that gent the sacred, but uninteresting knowledge of economics," + " while Larry provided good ole Jimmy with an endless supply of love, positivity and a helping hand." + "But this tale wonneth't be a tale lest our dear " + mainCharacter + " had been struck by Cupid's arrow.

So, naturally, " + "our goofy goober lad Larry had decided to be the man and shoot his shot." + "But Lord forbid the two to meet, for Natasha wast a sinful wh're, and the lady cared only about the gentlemen's wage, rather their breathtakin', jaw-droppin' allure... " + "So she slash'd poor Larry's heart in half, and the blood from the wound bore the salt of his tears; many of which he'd spilled that night on his pillow." + "Brokenhearted, Larry went to seek advice from " + friend + ", akin to what they've always done. He burs't through Jimmy's door, choking in his despair...only to find his friend, - his brother by heart but not his blood, his greatest joy yond lift'd him when the world push'd him down - smoochin' Natasha, as if she were his mistress. " + "Ever since then, Larry hath taken it upon himself to bring " + friend + " down, for revenge is a dish best served cold." + "To this day, the tale lives on, for no mate, no comrade knows of how this battle between Larry's undying brotherhood and his true love ends.")
